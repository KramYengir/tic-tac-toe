# The Odin Project - Tic-Tac-Toe Assignment

***An assignemt to practice the use of Javascript Factory Functions & Modules***

### Things I've learned while working on this assigment:

- Writing code without using global variables
- The importance (and difficulty) of decoupling functions
- Making my code more DRY
- Seperating code into UI, Logic, Data Objects etc... grouping (methods/modules)
- Creating (very) basic AI functionality
- Working with background images
- CSS aspect ratio property & not pseudo-class
- Using local font files

### Things I'm not hapy with:

- The time I spent on trivial matters...
- The lack of an unbeatable AI
- Some frustrations with layout at different sizes
